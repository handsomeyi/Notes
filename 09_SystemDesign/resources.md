I read this book on a friend’s recommendation who cleared FANG interviews. I’ll share pros and cons of this book, but overall, I will highly recommend it. This book is a must-have for all junior and mid-level engineers; for senior engineers, you will need more.  

I went through other resources like books, youtube videos, blogs, online courses, etc., I’ll try to list the best ones here to augment the studies (you can end up wasting your time on not-so-good resources, learn from my experience).  

Pros:  
- This book is concise and easy to read. You can easily finish it in a week.  
  -This book provides a step-by-step process to answer system design questions. This process was the best thing they have done. I will recommend this for everyone (senior/junior).  
  -The other best part of this book is the number of case studies they have discussed; for that alone, this book is worth every penny. In an interview, make sure you can explain these solutions.  
  -Each case study has reasonable depth; it is enough for up to mid-level engineers.  
  

Cons:  
- Senior engineers (me being one of them) have to read more. The same authors have an advanced system design online course (designgurus dot org); I went through it, easy read, highly recommend for senior engineers. More resources at the end.  
- The book covers important system design concepts like Load Balancing, Cashing, Proxies, etc. Some parts of it are great like Consistent Hashing, CAP/PACELC theorems, Bloom Filters, etc., but for some I had to read elsewhere to find details.  
- I felt a lack of details in a few case studies. Probably they wanted to make it a small book; see below resources that helped me the most to cover this.
